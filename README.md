# fcc-python-projects
This repository contains soultions for the projects included in the freeCodeCamp Python certification. The provided files passed all premade tests. The detailed project instructions are available at: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/.

1. arithmetic_arranger.py. The main goal of this project was to format simple mathematical problems with addition and subtraction operations.

2. time_calculator.py. This file adds time to an initial time value and tells the user the new time and even the day if a parameter was given.

3. budget.py. In this task, I created a budget app for categories of products and services (food, clothes etc.). The user can deposit, withdraw, transfer funds and an old-school-themed spend chart.

4. polygon.py. The polygon project was all about object oriented programming since I had to create a rectangle class with multiple geometrical methods. It also includes a square subclass.

5. probability.py. This file focuses on the statistical probability of drawing a certain combination of balls from a predetermined hat. The calculation is done with the help of thousands of iterations so the result is an approximation.
